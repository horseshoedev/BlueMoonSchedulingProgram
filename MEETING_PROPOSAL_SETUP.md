```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
SMTP_PORT=587
```

**SendGrid:**
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net

## Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:

1. **Update environment variables** with production SMTP credentials
2. **Set BASE_URL** to your production domain
3. **Use a professional FROM_EMAIL** address
4. **Consider using a transactional email service** (SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES) for better deliverability
5. **Implement rate limiting** for email sending to prevent abuse
6. **Add email templates** with your branding
7. **Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC** records for your domain

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

1. Check server logs for SMTP errors
2. Verify SMTP credentials in `.env`
3. Ensure firewall allows outbound SMTP connections (port 587 or 465)
4. Check spam folder
5. Try with a different SMTP provider

### "Less Secure App" Error (Gmail)

Use an App Password instead of your regular Gmail password.

### Emails Going to Spam

1. Set up SPF/DKIM/DMARC records
2. Use a transactional email service
3. Ensure FROM_EMAIL domain matches your sending domain
4. Add an unsubscribe link (for production)

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for this feature:

- **Response dashboard** showing real-time response statistics
- **Email reminders** for non-respondents
- **Calendar integration** to automatically schedule when all accept
- **Multiple time slot proposals** (let recipients vote on preferred times)
- **Email templates** with custom branding
- **Push notifications** for responses
- **Export responses** to CSV

## Security Notes

- Response tokens are cryptographically secure (32 bytes random)
- Tokens are one-time use and expire after response
- Only proposal creator can view responses
- Email endpoints use rate limiting to prevent abuse
- All user input is sanitized before sending emails
